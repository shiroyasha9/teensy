Hello!

We are excited to announce Teensy v7! This release is packed with major updates to our core technology stack, ensuring Teensy remains fast, secure, and modern.

## Next.js 16

Teensy has been updated to Next.js 16. This is a significant update that includes:

- **Security**: Resolves [CVE-2025-66478](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478).
- **Stable React Compiler**: Enabled by default for optimized rendering.
- **Turbopack**: Delivering crazy fast build times (3m -> 50s).
- **Node Runtime**: The workaround of calling `/api/url` in the middleware is no longer needed, as the proxy (RIP middleware 😭) file now runs on Node Runtime.

## Tailwind CSS v4

We've upgraded to Tailwind CSS v4 - a long time overdue. 

## Better Auth

As Next Auth (Auth.js) was acquired by Better Auth, it no longer receives regular updates. As such, we have migrated our authentication system to [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), providing a much streamlined experience. Nothing changes for you, the user - your account and teensies all are retained!

## General Maintenance

We've also performed general maintenance to keep the codebase healthy:

- Updated **Biome** to the latest version.
- Updated **Drizzle** and other packages to their respective latest versions.

Enjoy the new and improved Teensy!

The Teensy Team
